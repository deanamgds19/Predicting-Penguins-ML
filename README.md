# Predicting Penguin Species

For this project, my classmates and I chose 3 machine learning models (decision tree, linear regression and k-means) and used attributes such as Culmen length, Culmen depth, region, island, body mass, etc. to predict a penguin's species.

Our final analysis also included what model was most suitable for our situation and what flaws the other models contained that prevented higher accuracy.
