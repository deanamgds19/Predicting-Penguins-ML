# Predicting Penguin Species

For this project, my classmates and I chose 3 machine learning models and used them to predict a penguin's species using data on attributes such as Culmen length, Culmen depth, region, island, body mass, etc.  

Our final analysis also included what model was most suitable for our situation and what flaws the other models contained that prevented higher accuracy.
